# mc.css
mc.css lets you use Minecraft's design system in pure CSS, with extra features included with React.

## Installation
For just CSS, you can use a CDN:
```css
@import url("https://unpkg.com/@klashdevelopment/mc.css/styles/index.css");
```
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@klashdevelopment/mc.css/styles/index.css" />
```

For CSS or React, you can use the NPM package:
```sh
npm install @klashdevelopment/mc.css
```

Then, import the react components:
```tsx
import { ... } from "@klashdevelopment/mc.css";
```
